# theShowerApp

## Goal
This app was created for the UMass Dartmouth Sustainability Department with the goal of tracking how long students are in the shower.
The hope is that, with this data, more effective policies can be created that will encourage students to take shorter showers and thus conserve water.
A future goal is to gamify the app, so that it encourages students who are using it already to take shorter showers.

## Features

### Timer
The user may select from a predetermined list of timer lengths, the timer plays an alarm sound at the end that loops until the user tells it to stop.
When the timer is stopped, goal time and elapsed time are submitted to the database along with the user id.

The user may choose to connect their spotify account to our app. This enables the user to listen to their spotify playlists from within our app,
without the need to switch back and forth between our app and the Spotify App
